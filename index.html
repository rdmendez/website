    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Roger Mendez and I am a student at Florida Gulf Coast University. I am currently majoring in Computer Information Systems with a programming concentration.
         I have aspirations to become a future programmer and have had my mind set on it ever since my middle school days. My uncle is a computer programmer and seeing 
         what he does has pushed me to want to do the same.
        
        I find it really interesting that programming is what allows websites and applications to operate. I want to be able to create and develop such programs and apps.
        It would be awesome to receive recognition for a program that people put to everyday use. I would take pride in that and I know that with my work ethic and knowledge,
        I will be able to be recognized for it one day. I am willing to learn and put in countless hours with any project I am tasked to complete. 
        
        I played four years of basketball in high school, and despite only measuring 5'6, I was a starter for the Varsity team my final two years. During my junior year,
        I had complications from what should've been a simple surgery for appendicitis. I was told I could not play that entire year because of an enlarged heart that was 
        the result of the surgery.
